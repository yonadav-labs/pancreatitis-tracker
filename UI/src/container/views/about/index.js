						<p>Welcome to the ADAPT demonstration site.</p>
						<p>This research-only tool leverages manual-entry data to demonstrate state-of-art
						guidelines for acute pancreatitis management.</p>
						<p>For interest in a clinical-use enterprise version of ADAPT software with health record integration, submit your contact information using our Feedback survey and we
will contact you regarding a potential collaboration as a pilot center.</p>
						<p>Welcome to the Ariel Dynamic Acute Pancreatitis Tracker (ADAPT).</p>
						<p>This quality-improvement tool is designed to aid in caring for patients in
						the emergency department suffering from acute pancreatitis (AP).</p>
						<p>Using <Link to="/patient">clinical information and lab results</Link>, ADAPT
						automatically computes clinical scoring systems--including SIRS, HAPS, Panc 3,
						BISAP, POP, Ranson, Glasgow, APACHE-II, and JSS--and predicts persistent organ
						failure.</p>
						<p>Future versions of this tool will feature longitudinal data trends and
						integration with electronic medical records (EMR) to eliminate manual data
						entry.</p>
						<p>Please enter as much information as possible. ADAPT has been designed to work
						with all levels of patient data.</p>
						<p><strong>For the most informative set of results, please order a complete
						chemistry profile, complete blood count, and arterial blood gas.</strong></p>
						<p>Calculator tools function as presented at Digestive Disease Week 2019,

						Validation of a New Predictive Tool for Severity Assessment in a Large
